# ## Exercise: Python for loop
# 1. After flipping a coin 10 times you got this result,
# ```
# result = ["heads","tails","tails","heads","tails","heads","heads","tails","tails","tails"]
# ```
# Using for loop figure out how many times you got heads



print("\nExercise 1\n")
result = ["heads","tails","tails","heads","tails","heads","heads","tails","tails","tails"]
count = 0
for item in result:
    if item == "heads":
        count += 1
print("Heads count: ",count)
